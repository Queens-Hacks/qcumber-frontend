# Qcumber Frontend
This is the frontend flask application for Qcumber.

It was built over the course of one evening (to its current state) because I realized that we needed to hook the new scraper up to a new Qcumber frontend before course selection enters full swing.

It abuses elasticsearch as both a database and search engine for doing queries.

## Running
Create a virtualenv, and install the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install & start elasticsearch (currently default port is hardcoded because I am lazy)

place the output file generated by qcumber-scraper in the `out` dir within this directory and run `python fill.py` to load the data into elasticsearch. If you already have done this, wipe out elasticsearch by sending a `DELETE` http message to `qcumber/`.

Then simply run `python main.py` to start the server on port 3000.
